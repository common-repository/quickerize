Quickerize removes at least 100ms of latency from each of your page loads, which generates a minimum of 1% more in revenue and profit for you.

== Description ==

Instantly increase your revenue with 3x faster page loads.

[Quickerize](https://quickerize.com) removes at least 100ms of latency from each of your page loads, which generates a minimum of 1% more in revenue for you.

When a visitor is browsing your website, our system intelligently determines which pages they may view next and preloads them in the background. This results in significantly faster pages loads when visitors are moving between pages on your website.

Pages are preloaded only when our system detects that there's a good chance a user will visit them and only the HTML is preloaded (images, CSS and Javascript are already cached). This prevents your server from wasting resources loading these pages.

**NOTE:** This plugin requires a paid subscription from Quickerize.

1. Go to the Add New plugins screen in your WordPress Dashboard.
1. Click the upload tab.
1. Browse for the plugin file (quickerize.zip) on your computer.
1. Click "Install Now" and then hit the activate button.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you help me get everything setup? =

Sure, if you aren't comfortable setting it up yourself, just send us an email and our team will take care of everything for you. And don't worry, we'll do it for free!

= Is there anyone who shouldn't use this? =

We recommend using Quickerize on any website that makes over $2,500/month in profit. At that rate, our system will definitely generate more than you're paying to use it.

= Will this improve my score on speed testers? =

Probably not. Those tools only test the initial page load, whereas our system is designed to speed up the process of navigating between pages on your website.

Absolutely! In fact, you don't even need to explain why you want to cancel and we'll never ask. Just send us an email and we'll immediately cancel your account.

You can use Quickerize on any websites that you own. You're not required to pay for multiple subscriptions to use it on multiple websites - you can use it on all of them.
